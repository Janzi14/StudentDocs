            <p>Studying in Graz often means that you have to move out from home and start living on your own. This can
                be a challenge. Especially width limited money and resources.</p>
            <p>
                Hence, I have created this short Documentation for you.

        <section class="main-section" id="ACCOMMODATION">
            <header>
                <h2>Accommodation</h2>
            </header>
            <p>First and foremost you need a place to sleep. Luckily there are several different options.</p>
            <h3>Students home</h3>
            <p>This is the option, if you need some help cleaning, because in most accommodations like this, there is
                cleaning staff. This is also a great option, if you like getting to know new people and don't need too
                much space. </p>
            <h3>WGs</h3>
            <p>Here, you share your apartment with 2, 3 or sometimes 4 people. If you have friends, who want to live in
                Graz too, this is a great option.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that here no cleaning is done for you like in a Students Home</p>

                <h2>Food</h2>
            </header>
            <p>In my opinion this is the most important area of this page.</p>
            <p>Eating enough food while ensuring you are not overspending can be a huge problem for students. There are
                several ways to deal with this problem.</p>
            <p>For example, I have a job additional to my studies in order to be able to afford enough good food. I am a
                very hungry person, so without a job, it would be very difficult to get my calories in</p>
            <p>Another option is eating solely at places with student discounts.</p>
