# StudentDocs

## Objective
I created this little Documentation-Website to add another fun project to my Github-Profile.

With this specific project I want to refresh my Webdesign Skills.
## Structure
This Website just uses plain css and html.

## Idea
I got the idea from FreeCodeCamp.org and modified it.
